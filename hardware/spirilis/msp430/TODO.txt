APIs to implement:
	*digital I/O
	*interrupts
	*clocks - delay, sleep, sleepSeconds, suspend, wakeup
		- Add FRAM support
		- Add G2xxx/F2xxx support
	*HardwareSerial
	*SPI
		- Add transfer9() support
	I2C
		- Test all slave modes with a partner
		- Implement old-style USCI, eUSCI
	analogRead
	analogWrite (IRQ-driven double-buffered Timer_A updates, HW updates for B/D, use CCTL settings for hard-on/hard-off but not sure how to synchronize them)

	Extended features:
	SPI Slave
	fast Digital I/O
	USB
	IR extensions in HardwareSerial
	RTC - standard interface, periodic interrupt support, Software RTC code

	Libraries:
